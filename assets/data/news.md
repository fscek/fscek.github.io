- check out Die Zoone - website | https://branimirstivic.com/

ok, so i'm back from Velvet Festival with a brand new video recording.
Zolium had the idea of filming our sets, so he compiled them into the best MLG montage of 2009.

don't believe me? see for yourself below.
separate audio recordings are also available.

shout out to Branimir (Die Zoone) for the visuals, shout out to the dancers, and shout out to everyone who provided extra footage 🙏🙏

## szch.me IS LIVE! journalists call it “The SZCH Intranet”
date: 2024-03-20

and something else i forgot to mention in the title:
👴 SZCH TURNS 10 YEARS OLD IN 2024! 👴

will celebrate that by doing even more tracks and shows whenever i can.

i had the idea of a site and archive for a while now, something that feels like... home.
a lot of the stuff i've done over the years got scattered around the winds and storms of The Internet, so it feels really good to see it all come together under one roof.

after procrastinating for 6 months, i started making the site a week ago and this is how it turned out. nice'n'cute™, nothing complicated, easy to update and maintain.

tell all your friends and hop on here every once in a while to get some news and hear some music.

& if you're into c0mput3rZ, feel free to check out the site's repository on GitHub.

did i just make this thing into a blog? 😯😯
